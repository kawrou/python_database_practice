Exercise in querying PostgreSQL database with Python

Received a starter from Makers Bootcamp

In this exercise I'll be using:
Python
Pytest
PostgreSQL
psycopg library

I'm practicing how to use Python and psycopg to send SQL queries to a PostgreSQL database. 

I'm using an SQL file to seed data into the database and then querying that database. 

I'm using Pytest to implement TDD methodology to practice basic queries such as retrieving all data
and filtering data by ID.
