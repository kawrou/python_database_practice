Exercise in querying PostgreSQL database with Python

Received a starter from Makers Bootcamp

In this exercise I'll be using:
Python
Pytest
PostgreSQL
psycopg library

I'm practicing how to use Python and psycopg to send SQL queries to a PostgreSQL database. 

I'm using an SQL file to seed data into the database and then querying that database. 

I'm using Pytest to implement TDD methodology to practice basic queries such as retrieving all data
and filtering data by ID as well as creating and deleting. 

This is for practice and isn't intended to be fully functional therefore there is no persistance in the data 
as the seed file will automatically reset all the tables and data after the app has been run. 
It is purely for practicing sending SQL queries in python.
